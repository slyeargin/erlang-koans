    For these first few koans, the goal is to get
    each function to evaluate to \"true\" by
    replacing the \"__\" statement.

    If this is your first time using Erlang,
    learnyousomeerlang.com is a great resource (and
    it's consciously designed for programmers who are
    new to functional languages).  The \"Starting Out
    (for real)\" chapter should be enough to get you
    through these first few koans.";
